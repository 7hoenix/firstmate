# tests/fm-watch-triage.test.sh - the always-on wake triage built into
# bin/fm-watch.sh and the shared classifier (bin/fm-classify-lib.sh). The watcher
# now absorbs the benign majority of wakes in bash and exits ONLY on an actionable
# wake, so firstmate's LLM re-arms once per actionable event instead of once per
# wake. These tests cover the classifier predicates as pure functions, then drive
# a real fm-watch.sh subprocess to assert the behavioral contract:
# provably-working no-verb wakes absorbed (no exit, no queue entry, suppressor
# advanced, beacon fresh), stopped-crew no-verb wakes surfaced (queue + exit),
# provably-working stale panes absorbed-then-escalated past the threshold,
# terminal-looking stale status lines overridden by an active run, the heartbeat
# backstop fail-safe, and afk coherence (no double-triage while the away-mode
# daemon owns supervision).
#
# Daemon-side classification/injection lives in fm-daemon.test.sh; watcher/lock
# liveness in fm-watcher-lock.test.sh; the durable-queue safety matrix in
# fm-wake-queue.test.sh.

# The 2026-07-13 wake loop: a forgotten pause past its window rechecked on nearly
# every watcher cycle (observed at pause ages 3604/4202/4469/4598s - four rechecks
# in ~17 minutes) until the crew re-declared. Two faults compounded: surface_non
# terminal_stale wiped the .paused-resurfaced-<key> throttle when it fired, and a
# still-declared-paused crew whose authoritative verdict flickered to `none` (a
# bounded no-mistakes probe that timed out, a mis-attributed stale run) escaped to
# surface_nonterminal_stale instead of the throttled paused recheck - re-firing the
# moment the verdict read paused again. After the fix a still-declared pause
# surfaces at most once per PAUSE_RESURFACE_SECS - only an authoritative `working`
# cancels it - and the durable throttle survives every re-arm.

# that never changes. A single escalation reason looks identical every round,
# so nothing in the payload itself signals "this has now happened N times in a
# row" - that judgment call was left entirely to the supervisor noticing the
# repetition on its own. This is the safety-net fix: past
# FM_WEDGE_DEMAND_INSPECT_COUNT consecutive escalations on the SAME pane, the
